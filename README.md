# Library of criteria functions for chef-style AMNOG analyses

The chefCriteria package aims to provide a library of inclusion criteria functions 
for use in AMNOG analyses created by the chef package.

As the functions found in chefCriteria are designed to be used with chef,
it may be unwieldy to use these functions independently.
