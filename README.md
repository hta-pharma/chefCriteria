# A library of criteria functions for chef-style AMNOG analyses <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" alt="" />

The chefCriteria package aims to provide a library of inclusion criteria
functions for use in AMNOG analyses created by the chef package.

As the functions found in chefCriteria are designed to be used with
chef, it may be unwieldy to use these functions independently.

# Developer Setup

Please refer to the guidelines described in the ecosystem wrapper
package {ramnog}. [Developper
